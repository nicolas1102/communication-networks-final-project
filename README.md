# Website Usage Manager
The objective of this project is to make an extension for Google Chrome to regulate the harmful use of social networks by people on a daily basis, which will allow users to block not only social networks but any web page that the user wants to stop using. With this, every time the user wants to enter a social network or web page, the extension will block the web page that the user has previously blocked and will not let him navigate through it.

Here are some images of the extension:
